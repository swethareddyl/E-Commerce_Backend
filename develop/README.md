3. When I enter the command to invoke the application,then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags,then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core,then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
