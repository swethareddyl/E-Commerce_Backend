## Your Task

Task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file,then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

2. When I enter schema and seed commands,then a development database is created and is seeded with test data

3. When I enter the command to invoke the application,then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags,then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core,then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core:
